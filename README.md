# AcademyX

## Team Lead
[Achyuth Yogesh Sosale](https://github.com/achyuthcodes30)


This project is part of the ACM Industrial Experience Program 2024, which aims to simulate the real-world industrial process to develop and ship code.

## About the project

AcademyX is an E-learning platform hosted with the help of Azure cloud services like Azure App services and Azure PostgresSQL. The idea is to create an easy to use platform for interested people to upload their course 
and for learners to easily find topics they are interested in and get started with ease. 

While the implementation is scaled down to cover essential features of the project and strategies, the team will learn, in theory, how exactly a project of this nature can be scaled and enhanced on the cloud with async worker queues,
efficient load balancing etc.

## Features (scaled down implementation)

**User/learner Persona:**
- Easy to use, elegant UI built with NextJS and shadcn/ui themes and components
- Fuzzy searching for courses based on category
- Stateful session based Auth service for login/signup
- Star rating/review mechanisms
- Payment integration for subscriptions
- Optimal Video streaming

**Teacher Persona:**
Enjoys the same features as a learner but with the following additions:
- Easy to use course upload: Ability to easily set up course landing page, submodules and lessons with videos and an attached article.
- Course analytics dashboard

## Guidelines for contribution

1. **DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN:** While branch protection rules have been set up, this must still be kept in mind
2. Fork the repository or create branches with your name/ feature name.
3. Write meaningful commit messages in imperative, present tense.
4. Add commits wherever necessary, such as complex logic or code related to a newer library.
